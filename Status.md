# Project Status

**Current Phase:** Phase 1 — Hardware Fabrication & Bench Validation  
**Latest Release:** v0.1  
**Experimental Data:** None collected yet

## What Exists
- Complete theoretical motivation and phenomenological model
- Numerical sensitivity and falsification simulations
- Tier-1 hardware design, BOMs, and build instructions
- Formal, gated hardware validation protocol
- Firmware for rotation control, calibration injection, and readout
- All designs, firmware, and documentation released as open hardware / open source
  (CERN OHL-P v2 for hardware, MIT License for software)

## What Does NOT Yet Exist
- Physical hardware builds
- Calibration data
- Null or sidereal datasets
- Any experimental measurements or constraints
- Any claims of anomalous or new physical effects

## Interpretation Policy
No physical interpretation, anomaly discussion, or parameter constraints
are permitted until all Tier-1 validation gates are passed on real hardware.

Numerical “GO” decisions in this repository indicate only that the
instrumentation and analysis pipeline are sufficiently well-defined
to justify construction and bench validation.

## Repository Role
This repository currently represents a **methods, instrumentation,
and validation release**, intended to enable independent replication,
critical review, and controlled experimental testing.

Scientific conclusions, if any, must be based solely on validated
experimental data collected in accordance with the documented protocols.
