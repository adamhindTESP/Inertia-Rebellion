# Project Status

**Project:** Inertia Rebellion  
**Active Module:** AIRM Spinner  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 — Hardware Fabrication & Bench Validation  
**Latest Tagged Release:** v0.1  
**Experimental Data:** None collected yet

---

## What Exists

The following components are complete and publicly released:

- Theoretical motivation and phenomenological framework (AIRM)
- Numerical sensitivity and falsification simulations
- Tier-1 hardware design, BOMs, and build documentation
- Formal, gated hardware validation protocol
- Firmware for rotation control, calibration torque injection, and angular readout
- Open-source repository with versioned release (v0.1)

All designs, firmware, and documentation are released as open hardware /
open source (CERN OHL-P v2 and compatible software licenses).

## What Does NOT Yet Exist

The following do **not** exist at this stage:

- Physical hardware builds
- Calibration data
- Null datasets
- Sidereal or rotation-modulated datasets
- Any experimental measurements or constraints
- Any claims of new physics or anomalous effects

---

## Interpretation Policy

No physical interpretation, anomaly discussion, or parameter constraints
are permitted until all Tier-1 validation gates are passed on real hardware.

This repository currently represents a **methods, instrumentation, and
validation release only**.

---

## Intended Use

At this stage, the repository is intended to support:

- Independent hardware replication
- Bench-level validation and calibration
- End-to-end testing of analysis pipelines on real instruments
- Transparent review of experimental assumptions

It is **not** intended to support scientific claims prior to validation.

## Status Summary

> This project is in an **instrumentation-only phase**.
> Numerical studies motivate construction; no physical results are reported.

Updates to this file will accompany future tagged releases.
