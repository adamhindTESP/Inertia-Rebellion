abstract: >
  Inertia Rebellion (AIRM) is an open-source citizen science initiative
  developing precision torsion-balance instrumentation for testing
  inertial anisotropy and related frame-dependent effects.
  This v1.0.0 methods-only release documents:
  (1) a Mach-inspired phenomenological model,
  (2) numerical sensitivity and falsification simulations,
  (3) a quadrature demodulation analysis pipeline targeting
      f_spin ± f_sid sidebands,
  (4) ultra-slow Arduino-based spinner hardware and control firmware,
  and (5) Tier-1 validation and calibration gates with mandatory null tests.
  Numerical simulations establish a target sensitivity of order
  alpha ~ 1e-10.
  No experimental hardware has yet been built and no physical data or
  constraints are reported.
