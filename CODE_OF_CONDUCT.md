# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This project exists to support rigorous, falsifiable scientific work.
Disagreement is expected. Skepticism is welcome.
Personal attacks, misrepresentation, and bad-faith behavior are not.

This Code of Conduct defines the standards of interaction for all contributors,
reviewers, and participants in this repository.

---

## Expected Behavior

Participants are expected to:

- Critique ideas, methods, and assumptions — **not people**
- Engage in good faith, even when strongly disagreeing
- Represent others’ work accurately before criticizing it
- Distinguish clearly between evidence, interpretation, and speculation
- Respect stated project scope and limitations
- Accept correction without escalation
- Assume technical competence unless demonstrated otherwise

Strong criticism is acceptable.
Hostility is not.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- Personal attacks, insults, or harassment
- Dismissing work without engaging its content
- Misquoting or misrepresenting methods or results
- Asserting conclusions beyond what the data or simulations support
- Repeatedly ignoring documented scope limitations
- Advocacy, evangelism, or rhetorical persuasion in place of analysis
- Demands for deference based on status, credentials, or authority
- Bad-faith participation intended to provoke or derail discussion

Scientific disagreement does not justify disrespect.

---

## Scope Enforcement

This repository explicitly separates:

- **Numerical validation**
- **Experimental testing**
- **Physical interpretation**

Attempts to blur these boundaries — intentionally or unintentionally —
will be corrected.

Persistence in ignoring scope boundaries may result in moderation action.

---

## Handling Disputes

When disagreements arise:

1. Focus on specific claims, equations, code paths, or assumptions
2. Cite files, line numbers, or commits when possible
3. Propose falsification tests rather than rhetorical arguments
4. Avoid attributing motives or intent
5. If discussion stalls, open a focused issue or request mediation

The goal is resolution or clarification — not victory.

---

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or observe behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Open a private communication with the repository maintainer **or**
- Open an issue labeled `conduct` with a factual description

Reports should include:
- What happened
- Where it occurred
- Relevant links or excerpts
- Any prior attempts to resolve the issue

Retaliation against reporters will not be tolerated.

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take appropriate action in response to violations,
including but not limited to:

- Requests for clarification or correction
- Content removal or revision
- Temporary or permanent bans from participation
- Closure of issues or pull requests

Enforcement actions are discretionary and intended to protect the
scientific integrity of the project.

---

## Applicability

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- GitHub issues
- Pull requests
- Discussions
- Commit messages
- Documentation contributions

---

## Final Statement

This project welcomes scrutiny.
It does not welcome hostility, distortion, or bad-faith engagement.

The standard here is not agreement —
it is **intellectual honesty and methodological rigor**.
