# Release Notes — v0.1

**Project:** Inertia Rebellion  
**Module:** AIRM (Anisotropic Inertial Response Model)  
**Release Type:** Instrumentation & Methods  
**Experimental Data:** None

---

## Scope of This Release

Release **v0.1** constitutes a **methods-only instrumentation release**.

It includes:
- Phenomenological theory framing (AIRM)
- Numerical sensitivity and falsification simulations
- A fully specified analysis pipeline (simulation-based)
- Tier-1 hardware design and validation protocol
- Firmware for rotation control, calibration, and logging
- Documentation sufficient for independent replication

No experimental data, measurements, or constraints are included.

## What This Release Does NOT Claim

This release does **not**:
- Report experimental results
- Constrain physical parameters
- Assert the existence of anisotropic inertia
- Present calibrated hardware measurements

Numerical “GO” results indicate internal pipeline consistency only.

---

## Freeze Policy

All files associated with v0.1 are considered **frozen**.

Any of the following require a new tagged release:
- Changes to theory assumptions
- Changes to simulation models or analysis logic
- Changes to firmware behavior
- Changes to hardware validation criteria
- Introduction of experimental data

---

## Status

- Hardware: Not yet built
- Data: None collected
- Interpretation: Prohibited until validation gates are passed

This release exists to support **replication, review, and preparation** for future experimental work.
